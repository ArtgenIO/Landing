            Famous Thinker said: "Everything is an extension"... Or smth like
            that. Artgen heavily relies on the concept of extensions. We provide
            You with a gallery of predefined system concepts which can bootstrap
            your system.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Instead of You designing the next ecommerce platform from the get
            go, You can simply install the most common base structures and
            logic, and start from a well designed base point.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            So, what cloud has to do with this? We provide the platform for the community to create and share their designs in a centralized way which is built into the core of the system.

          To understand why We are doing this, I have to jump back in time...
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          For over 20 years, I was watching how programmers spend their lifetime
          rewriting the same simple scripts for a very similiar outcomes. Each
          company has their unique need, and as a software engineer it's our
          responsibility to satisfy it, but when we solved something we should
          not rewrite the solution over and over. This is why open source is so
          important for the world.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          This project's base idea started in 2016' january when our company
          took on an impossible 3 month deadline to create an ecommerce engine
          from ground zero, because the customer's need was so unique that none
          of the existing open source solution could be hacked to serve it. I
          knew that we could not deliver a project which had over 740~
          requirements with a standard project flow. So, I started to draft out
          a simple code generator, because most of the basic work we code is
          CRUD management. By simply designing the data model and generating
          every basic operation and user interface for it, we only had the
          business logic left, and with this we were able to release an MVP in 3
          month, from that point we just did what an agile company do and
          reiterated the needs every week.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          So, this was the first commit under the "Artgen" name, which was just
          an abbreviation for <strong>Art of Code Generation</strong>, because
          my goal was to get 98% of the code base generated in the first two
          week. And use the remaining time to implement the business logic.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Every since that time, I was experimenting with differnt approaches,
          first logical approach was to just abstract the code and build
          resources from simple descriptors. But, overtime the code becomes so
          entangled that it is not possible to release new features without
          breaking and messing up the code base.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          My next approach was to write a higher level DSL and transpile it into
          a lower level executable, this can be done and solves the entanglement
          and with just a bit of event sourced magic it can be used for huge
          projects with multiple independent team, but it still requires coding
          and the developers have to learn a new language. It's a no go.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Finally, at 2021' summer I took a 3 month break from working and
          started to experiment with no code / low code platforms. And over the
          summer I have learned that a headless CMS with a workflow engine can
          solve both of the problem. The simple approach of bringing everything
          to a user interface and handle the DSL as a flow chart, solves the
          business logic problem, and the CMS' data abstracting solves the
          entaglement.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          With this knowledge I have worked out a proof of concept which was
          able to build a SaaS application without writing a line of code. And
          this is where we decided with my Wife to start a project which finally
          tackles the fundamental problem. At this moment we are working hard
          toward a stable open source platform which will be able to bring
          business ideas to reality. Even for those whom can't spend millions on
          developments, and we will save developers from writing boring and
          repetative scripts.
