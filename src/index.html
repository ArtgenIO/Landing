          Famous Thinker said: "Everything is an extension"... Or smth like

        <p>
          Instead of You designing the next ecommerce platform from the get

      About Us

      <p>
        To understand why We are doing this, I have to jump back in time...
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        For over 20 years, I was watching how programmers spend their lifetime
        rewriting the same simple scripts for a very similiar outcomes. Each
        company has their unique need, and as a software engineer it's our
        responsibility to satisfy it, but when we solved something we should
        not rewrite the solution over and over. This is why open source is so
        important for the world.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        This project's base idea started in 2016' january when our company
        took on an impossible 3 month deadline to create an ecommerce engine
        from ground zero, because the customer's need was so unique that none
        of the existing open source solution could be hacked to serve it. I
        knew that we could not deliver a project which had over 740~
        requirements with a standard project flow. So, I started to draft out
        a simple code generator, because most of the basic work we code is
        CRUD management. By simply designing the data model and generating
        every basic operation and user interface for it, we only had the
        business logic left, and with this we were able to release an MVP in 3
        month, from that point we just did what an agile company do and
        reiterated the needs every week.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        So, this was the first commit under the "Artgen" name, which was just
        an abbreviation for <strong>Art of Code Generation</strong>, because
        my goal was to get 98% of the code base generated in the first two
        week. And use the remaining time to implement the business logic.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Every since that time, I was experimenting with differnt approaches,
        first logical approach was to just abstract the code and build
        resources from simple descriptors. But, overtime the code becomes so
        entangled that it is not possible to release new features without
        breaking and messing up the code base.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        My next approach was to write a higher level DSL and transpile it into
        a lower level executable, this can be done and solves the entanglement
        and with just a bit of event sourced magic it can be used for huge
        projects with multiple independent team, but it still requires coding
        and the developers have to learn a new language. It's a no go.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Finally, at 2021' summer I took a 3 month break from working and
        started to experiment with no code / low code platforms. And over the
        summer I have learned that a headless CMS with a workflow engine can
        solve both of the problem. The simple approach of bringing everything
        to a user interface and handle the DSL as a flow chart, solves the
        business logic problem, and the CMS' data abstracting solves the
        entaglement.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        With this knowledge I have worked out a proof of concept which was
        able to build a SaaS application without writing a line of code. And
        this is where we decided with my Wife to start a project which finally
        tackles the fundamental problem. At this moment we are working hard
        toward a stable open source platform which will be able to bring
        business ideas to reality. Even for those whom can't spend millions on
        developments, and we will save developers from writing boring and
        repetative scripts.
